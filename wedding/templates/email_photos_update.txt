Dear {{invitee.first_names}},

Thank you so much for attending our wedding a week ago!
It meant so much to us that you were able to be there to support
us as we entered into this new chapter of our lives.

We thought you might be interested in seeing photos 
of the wedding and reception as they are uploaded by
other guests (and as our photographers make them available).

You can find the current set of photos at:

    http://wedding.example.org/photos/{{invitee.invite_code}}/

You may also upload your own photos there for us (and others) to see.
Your login "invite code" for the website is: {{invitee.invite_code}}

Thank you so much!  It was wonderful to be able to share this with you.

Best wishes,

   Alyssa and Ben
