As we approach the date of our wedding, we'd like to provide you with
some updates.

We have updated our website (http://wedding.example.org/) with
information on places to stay and things to do while in Massachusetts
or California.

If you are planning to travel and attend our wedding in Massachusetts,
you may wish to consider making lodging reservations.  We have
obtained a small room block at the Hawthorne Hotel in Salem
(group code "555555"), but reservations must be made prior to July 26th.
We are also setting up a room block at the Marriott Boston Cambridge
Residence Inn Hotel in Kendall Square in Cambridge and will post
details on that to our website as they become available.

If you will be visiting from out of country, you may wish to start the
process of getting a visa, due to long wait times for interviews.
For details, see:  http://wedding.example.org/venue/MA/visa/

At any time, you can visit our website to check or update your RSVP status
and contact information:
