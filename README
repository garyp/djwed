Introduction to djWed:
----------------------

The djWed package is personal web-based wedding management software
written in the Python Django web framework.  This is a snapshot of
code that I wrote for my own wedding in the fall of 2010, and is
intended entirely as a starting point of code to evolve.  This
software is not intended to be something that works out-of-the-box,
but rather software that you can hack to do what you want.

When writing software for your own wedding, one encounters a pleasant
design constraint that is rarely encountered in software engineering:
code designed to be used exactly once.  In fact, I intend to get married
exactly once (now complete) and thus never use djWed ever again.

This meant that I took many short-cuts that I might not have otherwise taken,
but which made sense for expediency.  For example, generating mass emails
or PDF/PS output from SVG templates is fairly awkward.  However, it didn't
make sense for me to develop an elegant user experience for functions that
would be executed exactly once by just one person.  Similarly, I hard-coded
in that I'd have two wedding and reception venues ("MA" and "CA") as that
simplified some code.

However, now that our wedding is finished, some friends have asked to
use this code.  As such, it is now up to you, if you so choose, to
take this code as a starting point and to evolve it to match your
needs.  You'll encounter many bugs, hacks, quirks, and perhaps even
a few squirrels.  You are welcome to do the same as I did and adapt
the code for your single use, or you can do cleanup to generalize this
software so that it could more readily be used by others.

To get your feet wet, the included sample database should allow you to
try out this software on a local Linux machine after you make some
changes to settings.py by using "manage.py runserver" and then
connecting to localhost, but before you install it on a webserver.
More details are below...


Features:
---------

* Track guests and invitees (where each invitee may consist of multiple guests).
* Each invitee has an "invite code" that they can use to login.
* Invitees can update their contact information and leave comments.
* Invitees can RSVP and select meals and other options.
* Send mass emails to invitees with form-filling.
* Web-based reports on RSVPs, meal selections, and more.
* Spreadsheet exports of reports.
* Gift and thank-you note tracking.
* Generate mailing labels for invitees.
* Table assignment tracking (but no automated table-assignments).
* Multiple venue support (currently hard-coded at two venues in some places).
* Integrated photo gallery using a modified version of Photologue that lets
  guests upload their photos.
* Web-based editing of informational pages (HTML "page snippets").
* Initial import of guest information from a CSV spreadsheet.
* Generation of printed materials from SVG templates, including:
  - Save-the-date cards with RSVP invite codes.
  - Personalized place cards (even including food selection)
  - Personalized RSVP cards 
  - Personalized envelopes with artwork


Initial setup:
--------------

* Install Django and other appropriate packages.  At least some 
  of the packages you'll need (tested with Ubuntu Lucid) include:

      python-django           (tested with 1.1.1-2ubuntu1.3)
      python-django-tagging
      inkscape                (tested with 0.47.0-2ubuntu2)
      python-imaging
      python-reportlab
      python-excelerator

  (It is very possible that I missed some when putting this list together)

* Go through settings.py and make any necessary changes to file 
  paths, keys, etc.  

* Note that there's an example database provided in data/weddingdata-test.sqlite
  that should allow you to get started seeing if things even run.  You can start
  the sample server with:

       ./manage.py runserver 

* To create/initialize the database from scratch and setup admin user, move
  the data/weddingdata-test.sqlite file aside then run:

      ./manage.py syncdb

  (The example database provided uses the user "aphacker" with password "passw0rd")

* Startup the sample webserver in your staging environment with:

       ./manage.py runserver 

  then connect to the admin interface at:   http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

  (Note that you'll need to reload the login page due to a weirdness
  with CRSF protection which I've never bothered to fix.)

* Within the admin interface you may want to:

  - In the admin interface under Auth/Users, create a username for your fiance as well.

  - Under Wedding/PageSnipetts, you'll need to create some pages with specified names.
    In particular, small HTML page snippets with keys such as:
        
    	splash	   	 - Text for the top-level splash page
	photos
	faq
	gifts
	about-us
	MA/todo
	MA/lodging
	MA/lodging-codes
	MA/directions
	CA/todo

   (until you create the splash page, http://127.0.0.1:8000/ will fail to load)
   
   - Create a venue under Wedding/Venue.  (Unless you change things in code,
     sites must be "MA" and "CA").  Food options should have short descriptions
     of the form "MA:beef" and "MA:chicken" and "MA:veg".

  - Create some Invitees.  Each invitee may consist of multiple guests.
    (You can add some additional information per-invitee with an "Invitee Notes" object.)
    Invitee codes should be of the form ABC-123  (six alphanumeric characters).

  - There's some code to import Invitees and Guests 
    from a CSV spreadsheet in wedding/google_import.py

  - Once you have things working, you can also see more admin tools here:

  	http://127.0.0.1:8000/tools/

    from here you can generate mailing labels, reports, spreadsheets, and more.

  - An example guest in the database has invitee code "555-555"


* Go through the code and change cases of email addresses and text
  that are hard-coded in.  (For example, search for "example.org"
  and "Ben" and "Alyssa" and "September" and "October".)

  It may be helpful to do some of the replacing in batches,
  such as with:

     perl -pi -e 's/Ben Bitdiddle/My Real Name/' wedding/templates/*.html

 
* You likely want to change the colors, background image, etc 
  in media/style.css to be to your linking.


* On your production webserver install "libapache2-mod-wsgi" 
  then enable the wsgi module with "a2enmod wsgi".
  See "apache-siteconfig-example.conf" as an example site configuration
  (to go in /etc/apache2/sites-available).
  You'll also need to update paths in "django.wsgi"

  You should make sure that the database files aren't in a path that can be downloaded.



Various Notes
-------------

Various things you can do:

* Open up the shell to perform operations on objects:

      % ./manage.py shell
      >>> from djwed.wedding.models import *
      >>> RSVP.objects.filter(venue="MA",status="y").order_by("guest__last_name")
      >>> Guest.objects.all().order_by("last_name")


* Create an email template in the wedding/templates/email_*.{txt,html}
  and then use the django shell to send it out:

      % ./manage.py shell
      >>> from djwed.wedding.email import *
      >>> email_all_invitees("email_save_the_date.txt",
                             """Save the Date for Our Wedding!""",
                             send=False)
      >>> email_invitee("email_save_the_date.txt", 
	                """Save the Date for Our Wedding!""",
	                Invitee.objects.get(invite_code="555-555"))

* Example of getting a report of who is riding the bus:

     from djwed.wedding.models import *
     for r in RSVP.objects.filter(venue="MA",status="y").order_by("guest__last_name"):
       if not r.bus_selection or r.bus_selection = "none":
         print "%s,%s"%(r.guest.full_name(),r.bus_selection)     

* Some of the scripts in "bin" are ones I used to backup the database
  as well as to sync out new versions of the code with a backup beforehand.


Other random notes:

* I strongly encourage you to read up on Django and go through its tutorials
  separately before diving in and getting started here.

* Before starting, familiarize yourself with the data model in wedding/models.py.
  Some of the most important aspects are:

       An "Invitee" has an invite_code and is tied to one or more "Guests".
       Address information is associated with Invitees, and you can think
       of Invitees as a set of guests living together.

       A "Guest" corresponds to a person with a name and email address.

       Each "RSVP" is tied to exactly one "Guest" and one "Venue".


* This code was intended to be used for a wedding with two "venues": a
  wedding and reception in Massachusetts ("MA") and a second reception
  in California ("CA").  This assumption is heavily hard-coded into
  many places.

* This package was originally called "eriksu" when I was developing
  it, but I've renamed it to "djwed".  I may have missed some places.

* Generating printed materials from Inkscape doesn't yet work headless.
  In order to get this to work, copy the production sqlite db locally
  and then run djwed on a desktop with X11.  (Something future would
  be to give Inkscape a fake headless X-server for it to use, although
  some gnome bits also seem to come into play.)

* Printed materials are generated from SVG files created in Inkscape,
  but then annotated with django form processing directives.  If you
  edit them in Inkscape, you may need to re-add the processing
  directives.


Notes for changes you may wish to make:

* I'm still using the older (and somewhat flakey) Django CSRF
  middleware functionality which has been replaced in newer version.

* Create a better web interface for sending mass emails.
